## Word Vectors Resources

[A neural probabilistic language model.](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1839-a-neural-probabilistic-language-model.pdf)  
Bengio 2003. Seminal paper on word vectors.  

[Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781v3.pdf)  
Mikolov et al. 2013. Word2Vec generates word vectors in an unsupervised way by attempting to predict words from a corpus. Describes Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Continuous Skip-gram models for learning word vectors.  
Skip-gram takes center word and predict outside words. Skip-gram is better for large datasets.  
CBOW - takes outside words and predict the center word. CBOW is better for smaller datasets.  

[Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality]
(http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf)  
Mikolov et al. 2013. Learns vectors for phrases such as "New York Times." Includes optimizations for skip-gram: heirachical softmax, and negative sampling. Subsampling frequent words. (i.e. frequent words like "the" are skipped periodically to speed things up and improve vector for less frequently used words)

[Mikolov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oBu8kMMAAAAJ&hl=en) et al. 2013. Performs well on word similarity and analogy task.  Expands on famous example: King â€“ Man + Woman = Queen

[Le](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vfT6-XIAAAAJ), Mikolov. 2014.  Introduces Paragraph Vector. Concatenates and averages pretrained, fixed word vectors to create vectors for sentences, paragraphs and documents. Also known as paragraph2vec.  Doesn't use a parse tree.  
Implemented in [gensim](https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/).  See [doc2vec tutorial](http://rare-technologies.com/doc2vec-tutorial/)

Tai et al. 2015  Introduces Tree LSTM. Uses a parse tree.

[Semi-supervised Sequence Learning](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.01432.pdf)  
Dai, Le 2015  
Approach: "We present two approaches that use unlabeled data to improve sequence learning with recurrent networks. The first approach is to predict what comes next in a sequence, which is a conventional language model in natural language processing.
The second approach is to use a sequence autoencoder..."  
Result: "With pretraining, we are able to train long short term memory recurrent networks up to a few hundred
timesteps, thereby achieving strong performance in many text classification tasks, such as IMDB, DBpedia and 20 Newsgroups."

Joulin, Grave, Bojanowski, Mikolov 2016 Facebook AI Research.  
"Our experiments show that our fast text classifier fastText is often on par with deep learning classifiers in terms of accuracy, and many orders of magnitude faster for training and evaluation."
